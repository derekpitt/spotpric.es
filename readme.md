## Why?

I couldn't find a simple one page site that listed the current prices in real time. I don't want to see graphs and have to make choices, just show me the prices!

# Running

First, set up your environment:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."

Then, ```./run_server```
